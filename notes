I want my portrait to use clamp.

try to be as tall as the container
but when the width of the img is larger
than the portrait-container width
what should I do?

I want it to not pass the size of whats available
within the portrait-container, which is just the
space within 240px of padding

How can I base the height of the img on the
max-height of the portrait-container but also
prevent it from scaling when that would cause
the width to get too large?
