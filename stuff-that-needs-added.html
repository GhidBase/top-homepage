                            I made this website as a passion project when I
                            started The Odin Project. In lots of ways, it made
                            TOP take much longer than it needed to. But I don't
                            regret it. Lucky Defense Guides gave me time to
                            practice what I learned, and made me do it in a way
                            that was good enough for my users - as of today, LDG
                            has had half a million views, and is even maintained
                            by a team of 5 people! The community that's been
                            built around this game has been truly inspiring and
                            I can't wait to see it grow further.

                            other players. Using GoogleAuth, players can also
                            pick right up where they left off on any other
                            device and continue playing on the same account.

                            Learning how to traverse a tree was one of the most
                            fun Data Structures related experiences I've had. It
                            really shows you how recursion can go from being an
                            intimidating thing to feeling simple. After I did
                            this project I had to make an active effort to STOP
                            thinking recursively. Another bonus of this project
                            was that I got to actually use the HashMap system
                            I'd built. JavaScript has one built in sure, but it
                            feels good to build your own tools - at least to
                            learn how they really work.
