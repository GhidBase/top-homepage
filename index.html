                            I made this website as a passion project when I
                            started The Odin Project. In lots of ways, it made
                            TOP take much longer than it needed to. But I don't
                            regret it. Lucky Defense Guides gave me time to
                            practice what I learned, and made me do it in a way
                            that was good enough for my users - as of today, LDG
                            has had half a million views, and is even maintained
                            by a team of 5 people! The community that's been
                            built around this game has been truly inspiring and
                            I can't wait to see it grow further.

                            Learning how to traverse a tree was one of the most
                            fun Data Structures related experiences I've had. It
                            really shows you how recursion can go from being an
                            intimidating thing to feeling simple. After I did
                            this project I had to make an active effort to STOP
                            thinking recursively. Another bonus of this project
                            was that I got to actually use the HashMap system
                            I'd built. JavaScript has one built in sure, but it
                            feels good to build your own tools - at least to
                            learn how they really work.
